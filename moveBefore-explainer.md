# State-preserving move: Explainer

## Overview
DOM State-preseving move is a new primitive that fixes a long-standing web constraint: since moving
an element in the DOM means removing and re-inserting it, a lot of its state gets reset. The most
apparent effect of this is that when elements that contain iframes are moved around the DOM, the
iframes themselves get reloaded.

This is currently a WhatWG state 1 proposal.

### The pain point
This is a pain point that have brought to existence pretty heavy library that try to mitigate it,
e.g. [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) that tries its best to move elements
"around" a stateful element to avoid removing it. Other libraries like [htmx](https://htmx.org/) have
elaborate workarounds for this issue.

### What state gets reset
We've identified a short list of features that represent state that gets reset when an element is
removed and re-inserted:

  1. IFrames get reloaded
  1. A focused element loses its focus
  1. Text selection is cleared
  1. Fullscreen is existed
  1. A popover is closed
  1. A modal dialog ceases to be modal
  1. CSS animations & transitions are reset
  1. Pointer/touch events are cancelled

## The proposed solution

### The API

The proposed new API is a new DOM function: `Node.prototype.moveBefore`. It's a drop-in replacement for
[`Node.prototype.insertBefore`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-node-insertbefore), and behaves in the 
exact same way, except for the following:

1. The element state defined above does not get reset. IFrames stay loaded, focused elements stay focused
   (as long as they didn't move to an inert tree), CSS transitions continue or get triggered, etc.
2. The author gets reflection of this in web components: a new optional `movedCallback`, which is invoked
   instead of `disconnectedCallback` and `connectedCallback` when an element that has it declared is moved
   in a state-preserving manner.
3. New information in mutation observers (exact API shape TBD).

See discussion at https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1255.

### Constraints

To simplify the API, both the node and new container need to be [connected](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#connected), part of the same document, and also part of the
same [node tree](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-tree). The same-tree requirement can maybe be eased in the future.

### A few specifics

#### IFrames
When an iframe is moved, it does not reload, and does not fire events.

#### Focus
When a focused element is moved, it generally stays focused. In the next [focus fixup](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model%3Afocusing-steps), it might lose focus and fire blur events, if for example it was moved into a hidden or inert subtree.

## Considered alternatives

### An iframe attribute

e.g. a `preserve` attribute. this felt like the wrong layer to implement such a feature.

### Changing the default behavior

A bit risky in terms of subtle reliance on current behavior in existing websites.

## [Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy](https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/)

> 01.  What information does this feature expose,
>      and for what purposes?

It does not "expose" any new information, but rather allows skipping 

> 02.  Do features in your specification expose the minimum amount of information
>      necessary to implement the intended functionality?

Yes, they don't expose anything more than the new function.

> 03.  Do the features in your specification expose personal information,
>      personally-identifiable information (PII), or information derived from
>      either?

No

> 04.  How do the features in your specification deal with sensitive information?
> 05.  Does data exposed by your specification carry related but distinct

>      information that may not be obvious to users?

No

> 06.  Do the features in your specification introduce state
>      that persists across browsing sessions?

No

> 07.  Do the features in your specification expose information about the
>      underlying platform to origins?

No

> 08.  Does this specification allow an origin to send data to the underlying
>      platform?

No

> 09.  Do features in this specification enable access to device sensors?

No

> 10.  Do features in this specification enable new script execution/loading
>      mechanisms?

No

> 11.  Do features in this specification allow an origin to access other devices?

No

> 12.  Do features in this specification allow an origin some measure of control over
>      a user agent's native UI?

No

> 13.  What temporary identifiers do the features in this specification create or
>      expose to the web?

No

> 14.  How does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and
>      third-party contexts?

It's not applicable to this API

> 15.  How do the features in this specification work in the context of a browserâ€™s
>      Private Browsing or Incognito mode?

N/a

> 16.  Does this specification have both "Security Considerations" and "Privacy
>      Considerations" sections?

The DOM specification [does](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#security-and-privacy), but it's not
really applicable.

> 17.  Do features in your specification enable origins to downgrade default
>      security protections?

No

> 18.  What happens when a document that uses your feature is kept alive in BFCache
>      (instead of getting destroyed) after navigation, and potentially gets reused
>      on future navigations back to the document?

Nothing special, this API only works when used on an active document.

> 19.  What happens when a document that uses your feature gets disconnected?

The feature is built in such a way that a document cannot be disconnected in the middle of using
the feature. When used on disconnected documents, this feature falls back to existing behavior.

> 20.  Does your feature allow sites to learn about the users use of assistive technology?

No

> 21.  What should this questionnaire have asked?

Nothing in particular.
