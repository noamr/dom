# State-preserving move: Explainer

## Overview
DOM State-preseving move is a new primitive that fixes a long-standing web constraint: since moving
an element in the DOM means removing and re-inserting it, a lot of its state gets reset. The most
apparent effect of this is that when elements that contain iframes are moved around the DOM, the
iframes themselves get reloaded.

### The pain point
This is a pain point that have brought to existence pretty heavy library that try to mitigate it,
e.g. [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom) that tries its best to move elements
"around" a stateful element to avoid removing it. Other libraries like [htmx](https://htmx.org/) have
elaborate workarounds for this issue.

### What state gets reset
We've identified a short list of features that represent state that gets reset when an element is
removed and re-inserted:

  1. IFrames get reloaded
  1. A focused element loses its focus
  1. Selection is cleared
  1. Top level UI is closed (fullscreen, popover, modal)
  1. CSS animations & transitions are reset
  1. Pointer/touch events are cancelled

## The proposed solution

### The API

The proposed new API is a new DOM function: `Node.prototype.moveBefore`. It's (almost) a drop-in replacement for
[`Node.prototype.insertBefore`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-node-insertbefore), and behaves in the 
exact same way, except for the following:

1. The element state defined above does not get reset. IFrames stay loaded, focused elements stay focused
   (as long as they didn't move to an inert tree), CSS transitions continue or get triggered, etc.
2. The author gets reflection of this in web components: a new optional `movedCallback`, which is invoked
   instead of `disconnectedCallback` and `connectedCallback` when an element that has it declared is moved
   in a state-preserving manner.

See discussion at https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1255.

### Constraints

Both the node and new container need to be either [connected](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#connected) or disconnected, and part of the same document.
When these constraints are not met, `moveBefore` throws an exception. That is because, at the moment, there is no design that allows us to move nodes
across documents or have them change their connected state without side effects like script execution, which would in some cases be widely inconsistent
with "moving".

### A few specifics

#### IFrames
When an iframe is moved, it does not reload, and does not fire events.

#### Focus
When a focused element is moved, it generally stays focused. In the next [focus fixup](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model%3Afocusing-steps), it might lose focus and fire blur events, if for example it was moved into a hidden or inert subtree.

### Selection
Selection is currently not preserved. This can be addressed in future version. At the moment, moving is constrained to "intrinsic" state of the node, and not to state that relates to other nodes, like ranges.


## Considered alternatives

### An iframe attribute

e.g. a `preserve` attribute. this felt like the wrong layer to implement such a feature, and the moving primitive is anyway designed to do much more than iframe state preserving.

### Changing the default behavior of existing DOM methods

This was thoroughly considered and attempted.
Once constraint that allowed us to perform an "atomic" move is the fact that the API works on one element at a time.
Modern APIs, like [`before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/before) or [`append`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append), accept multiple elements, some of which can be moved and some of which cannot.
This complicates the API a lot, and we haven't found a satisfactory solution that would feel safe as a drop-in replacement for these.

This leaves us with [`insertBefore`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore), [`appendChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) and [`replaceChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/replaceChild).
Those have been around for a long time, which brings a web-compatibility risk. In addition, applying a move semantic to 3 APIs and not to the rest would create confusing inconsistency in an API where consistency is key.

### Falling back to `insertBefore` when moving is not possible

This is a [controversial topic](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/1255).

A request that repeats a lot from web developers is for `moveBefore` to be a drop-in replacement for `insertBefore`, that works under the same conditions.
However, this would make `moveBefore` inconsistent, as it would move the node without side-effects under some conditions, and incur side-effects, some of which might be major like reloading iframes or running scripts, under other conditions.

It is possible for callers to turn `moveBefore` into a drop-in replacement for `insertBefore` by checking for [`isConnected`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/isConnected) or by catching the move-specific exceptions,
and most early adopters of this API from the library/framework space are likely to use it in this way to incorporate them into their existing code.

However, it is not embedded into the initial version API for deliberate reasons - `moveBefore` predictably moves the node without side-effects. This is something developers can count on, given the conditions.
Developers are encouraged to think about "moving" as a bespoke DOM operation, rather than as a "better insert". By doing so, developers can craft their use of the DOM APIs in a way that *always* moves when it can,
rather than "try to move but fall back", inevitably resulting in a user experience where iframes are *sometimes* reloaded and focus is *sometimes* lost.

In other words, the DOM API goes to a pretty low level. Having a primitive that *just* moves and fails if it can't is the prudent first baby step for this new functionality.

## Possible future enhancements

### `appendChild` and `replaceChild` versions

We could have convenience functions that move the node to the end, or remove a child and move the node in its place. This should be a somewhat simple addition.

### A version that falls back to insertion

A method like `moveOrInsertBefore` can be a drop-in replacement for `insertBefore` that moves when it can and insert when it can't.
As mentioned before, we should tackle this later on, when we understand how useful `moveBefore` is as a drop-in replacement for `insertBefore`, vs. using it as a new primitive at a higher level.
This should come after some time has passed, when the adoption of this API goes a bit beyond incorporating it into existing code that was originally tuned to a world where atomic moves were impossible.

### Batch moves

To incorporate move operations into batch functions like [`append`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append), we'd have to design the semantic of how this should behave when trying to append some elements that are
movable and some that are not, and whether this changes the order of removal/insertion effects. It might be possible to add a version that throws if *any* of the nodes is not movable, however it's unclear how useful that is.
In addition, we can envision some sort of "transaction" model where several operations take place, and the effect is either moves or insertions, based on the initial and final state of the nodes, disregarding intermediate state.

Also, given such mechanism, it might be possible to think of preserving tree state such as selection ranges.
To conclude, moving multiple elements at the same time is orders of magnitude more complex than moving a single element, which is complex by itself, hence it is deferred to a future API.

Nothing special, this API only works when used on an active document.

Nothing in particular.
